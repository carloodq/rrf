# ML Frameworks, Libraries, and Tools
[Back to the Top](https://github.com/mikeroyal/Machine-Learning-Guide#table-of-contents)

[TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org) is an end-to-end open source platform for machine learning. It has a comprehensive, flexible ecosystem of tools, libraries and community resources that lets researchers push the state-of-the-art in ML and developers easily build and deploy ML powered applications.

[Keras](https://keras.io) is a high-level neural networks API, written in Python and capable of running on top of TensorFlow, CNTK, or Theano.It was developed with a focus on enabling fast experimentation. It is capable of running on top of TensorFlow, Microsoft Cognitive Toolkit, R, Theano, or PlaidML.

[PyTorch](https://pytorch.org) is a library for deep learning on irregular input data such as graphs, point clouds, and manifolds. Primarily developed by Facebook's AI Research lab.

[Amazon SageMaker](https://aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/) is a fully managed service that provides every developer and data scientist with the ability to build, train, and deploy machine learning (ML) models quickly. SageMaker removes the heavy lifting from each step of the machine learning process to make it easier to develop high quality models.

[Azure Databricks](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/databricks/) is a fast and collaborative Apache Spark-based big data analytics service designed for data science and data engineering. Azure Databricks, sets up your Apache Spark environment in minutes, autoscale, and collaborate on shared projects in an interactive workspace. Azure Databricks supports Python, Scala, R, Java, and SQL, as well as data science frameworks and libraries including TensorFlow, PyTorch, and scikit-learn.

[Microsoft Cognitive Toolkit (CNTK)](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cognitive-toolkit/) is an open-source toolkit for commercial-grade distributed deep learning. It describes neural networks as a series of computational steps via a directed graph. CNTK allows the user to easily realize and combine popular model types such as feed-forward DNNs, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and recurrent neural networks (RNNs/LSTMs). CNTK implements stochastic gradient descent (SGD, error backpropagation) learning with automatic differentiation and parallelization across multiple GPUs and servers.

[Apple CoreML](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/coreml) is a framework that helps integrate machine learning models into your app. Core ML provides a unified representation for all models. Your app uses Core ML APIs and user data to make predictions, and to train or fine-tune models, all on the user's device. A model is the result of applying a machine learning algorithm to a set of training data. You use a model to make predictions based on new input data.

[Apache OpenNLP](https://opennlp.apache.org/) is an open-source library for a machine learning based toolkit used in the processing of natural language text. It features an API for use cases like [Named Entity Recognition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Named-entity_recognition), [Sentence Detection](), [POS(Part-Of-Speech) tagging](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Part-of-speech_tagging), [Tokenization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokenization_(data_security)) [Feature extraction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feature_extraction), [Chunking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chunking_(psychology)), [Parsing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parsing), and [Coreference resolution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coreference).

[Apache Airflow](https://airflow.apache.org) is an open-source workflow management platform created by the community to programmatically author, schedule and monitor workflows. Install. Principles. Scalable. Airflow has a modular architecture and uses a message queue to orchestrate an arbitrary number of workers. Airflow is ready to scale to infinity.

[Open Neural Network Exchange(ONNX)](https://github.com/onnx) is an open ecosystem that empowers AI developers to choose the right tools as their project evolves. ONNX provides an open source format for AI models, both deep learning and traditional ML. It defines an extensible computation graph model, as well as definitions of built-in operators and standard data types.

[Apache MXNet](https://mxnet.apache.org/) is a deep learning framework designed for both efficiency and flexibility. It allows you to mix symbolic and imperative programming to maximize efficiency and productivity. At its core, MXNet contains a dynamic dependency scheduler that automatically parallelizes both symbolic and imperative operations on the fly.

## Deep Learning Learning Resources

[Deep Learning](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/learn/deep-learning) is a subset of machine learning, which is essentially a neural network with three or more layers.

## Reinforcement Learning Learning Resources

[Reinforcement Learning](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/learn/deep-learning#toc-deep-learn-md_Q_Of3) is a subset of machine learning, which is a neural network with three or more layers. These neural networks attempt to simulate the behavior of the human brain,though, far from matching its ability. This allows the neural networks to "learn" from a process in which a model learns to become more accurate for performing an action in an environment based on feedback in order to maximize the reward. The Learning can be [supervised](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supervised_learning), [semi-supervised](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semi-supervised_learning) or [unsupervised](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unsupervised_learning).

It supports GPU operation and automatic differentiation using dynamic computational graphs for models defined in plain Julia.

[Distributions.jl](https://github.com/JuliaStats/Distributions.jl) is a Julia package for probability distributions and associated functions. 

[DataFrames.jl](http://juliadata.github.io/DataFrames.jl/stable/) is a tool for working with tabular data in Julia.

[Flux.jl](https://fluxml.ai/) is an elegant approach to machine learning. It's a 100% pure-Julia stack, and provides lightweight abstractions on top of Julia's native GPU and AD support.

[IRTools.jl](https://github.com/FluxML/IRTools.jl) is a simple and flexible IR format, expressive enough to work with both lowered and typed Julia code, as well as external IRs.

[Cassette.jl](https://github.com/jrevels/Cassette.jl) is a Julia package that provides a mechanism for dynamically injecting code transformation passes into Julia’s just-in-time (JIT) compilation cycle, enabling post hoc analysis and modification of "Cassette-unaware" Julia programs without requiring manual source annotation or refactoring of the target code.
